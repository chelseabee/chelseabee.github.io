Take a look at my portfolio, I hope you Enjoy! 




1/11/2022 - learning about responsive nav using html/ css/ js. The Nav is currently in a very ugly state, but hopefully I can figure out how to beautify it more. I'm defintely getting more comfortable with media inquiries and I just learned about @supports which is another awesome feature. I am realizing that I dont really know much in the way of alt device usage ( not even sure if thats what you call it) along the lines of screen readers etc, I need to pick up on more accesible code techniques. I am also realizing that classes are likely the most readable selectors in css (I could be wrong, but right now they feel the most minimal). 

1/18/22 - sooooo Bootstrap is a thing. I am in the process of changing my portfolio over to include bootstrap. I dont want to use to many design elements, for fear of looking too generic, but the responsive aspect and the grid/ flex properties are pretty amazing from a time/ beginner standpoint. I have a fear that employers may not like to see bootstrap, that they would prefer some raw css, but I also find it vaulable to know more technologies? .... oh the struggle. 

1/21/22 ---- so bootstrap is a great awesome thing, but I am not going to use it for my portfolio. I made a great landing page with it, but I do want to showcase that I can do more than just use bootstrap, so here we are on portfolio 3.0. I have decided to tone down my color usage a little, and I have decided to go with some tones that I have decided to kindly refer to as 'French Retro'. Am I cringey... maybe, but its just so dang cute I cant help myself. I am also getting so so much faster at making these which is awesome. I am hoping to add some JS elements to really make the design fun, as well as a personal photo.. which is hard for me, but we'll get there. 

1/22/22 --- "WOOP" ladies and gentelmen we have a responsive navigation!! I am so excited about this one, I even was able to implement a little bit of JS, which is something I hope to work with more and more. I was having a heck of a time trying to get the nav links to be hidden while they were "inactive" they did not want to go, but after a little tinkering I was able to make them display:none until toggled active. I didnt really realize that if you are going to have a display property, there can not be other display properties because they cancel eachother out, but now I know, you cannot have a flex and a none, and it totally makes sense.
